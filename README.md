Refactored a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.

This app is built using the MERN stack with a React front end, [CloudMongoDB](https://cloud.mongodb.com/), and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)/[Express](https://expressjs.com/) server, API and set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.
